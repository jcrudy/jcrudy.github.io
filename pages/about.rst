I'm a scientist who, although he loves science, doesn't love universities or conferences or grant applications.  I like writing software, designing experiments, and analyzing data.  Sometimes I use my math and computer skills to help businesses solve problems.  I'm particularly good at building predictive models.  People like me are called data scientists, at least if they live in California.  I live in California.  I spend my time working on my own projects, working on projects others have hired me for, and posing for portraits.  This is my blog.
