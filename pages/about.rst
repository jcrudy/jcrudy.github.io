About Me
========


I'm a scientist who, although he loves science, doesn't love universities or conferences or grant applications.  I like writing software, designing experiments, and analyzing data.  Sometimes I use my math and computer skills to help businesses solve their businessy problems.  People like me are called data scientists, at least if they live in California.  I live in California.  I spend my time working on my own projects, working on projects others have hired me for, and posing for portraits.  This is my blog.
